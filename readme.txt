Code Explanation
In the script, the main function orchestrates the execution flow. It starts by calling combine_repositories to aggregate commit data from multiple repositories. The combine_repositories function uses get_repo to initialize each repository, get_commits to retrieve commits (optionally filtering by branches), extract_commit_info to parse commit details, and filter_commits to exclude irrelevant commits.

Next, main calls group_commits_by_contributor to organize commits by contributor. It then calls sort_commits_by_timestamp to sort these commits chronologically for each contributor. The calculate_active_work_time function computes the active work hours per contributor based on commit timestamps.

The split_time_periods function categorizes commits into different periods (week, month, year) for time-based analysis. The calculate_time_by_commit function computes the time spent between commits for each contributor and sorts them in descending order of time spent.

Finally, display_results presents the total hours, hours per contributor, and time by commit. The generate_timesheet function prepares timesheet entries, and output_timesheet saves the timesheet in a standard agency format as a CSV file.

F5+: Advanced Insights
display_results
output_timesheet
By organizing functions into appropriate F-levels, we've maintained minimal complexity and ensured that each function builds upon the previous layers.

Outputs and New Functionalities
Total Hours and Hours per Person
The script calculates the total active work hours and displays hours per contributor:

yaml
Copy code
Total Active Work Hours: 120.50 hours

Hours per Contributor:
----------------------
Alice: 60.25 hours
Bob: 40.15 hours
Charlie: 20.10 hours
Time Split into Periods
The split_time_periods function organizes commits into weeks, months, and years for further analysis. This data can be used to generate period-specific reports or visualizations.

Timesheet Generation
The script generates a timesheet in CSV format (timesheet.csv) that can be submitted to clients for billable hours. The timesheet includes contributors and their total hours, formatted according to standard agency practices.

Combining Multiple Repositories
By passing multiple repository paths to the script, it combines commit data from all specified repositories, allowing for comprehensive analysis across projects.

Hours by Branch
While the current implementation includes a placeholder for branch information (get_commit_branch function), further development can enhance this functionality to accurately associate commits with branches and calculate hours by branch.

Time by Commit Name
The calculate_time_by_commit function computes the time spent between commits and orders them with the most time at the top. The display_results function presents the top commits with the most time spent.

Instructions and Usage
Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.9 installed. Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Script

bash
Copy code
python git_hours.py /path/to/repo1 /path/to/repo2 --branches main develop
Replace /path/to/repo1 and /path/to/repo2 with the actual paths to your repositories. Use --branches to specify branches to analyze.

Outputs

Console Output: Displays total hours, hours per contributor, and time by commit.
Timesheet: Saves timesheet.csv in the current directory.
Additional Notes
Branch Handling

Determining the branch for each commit can be complex due to Git's structure. The get_commit_branch function currently returns None. Advanced Git operations would be needed to accurately map commits to branches.

Time Period Analysis

While the script splits commits into periods, additional functions can be developed to generate period-specific reports or visualizations.

Extensibility

The code is modular and can be extended to include features like:

Predictive modeling of future productivity.
Comparative analytics across teams or time periods.
Integration with reporting tools or APIs.
Conclusion
We've expanded the git-hours script to include advanced functionalities, adhering to the SLMCF methodology. Functions are organized into appropriate F-levels, and we've added detailed comments and explanations. The script now provides comprehensive analysis of work hours, supports multiple repositories, and generates a timesheet suitable for client billing.
